### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently diving into the world of machine learning, eager to learn and grow in this exciting field. I'm looking to collaborate on beginner-friendly projects that involve:

- Building and training machine learning models
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory data analysis
- Experimenting with different algorithms and techniques

If you're working on a project where I can contribute, learn, and gain hands-on experience, I'd love to connect!
